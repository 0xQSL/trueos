Files with no changes against uptstream:
intel_crt.c
intel_ddi.c
intel_hdmi.c
intel_dvo.c


Files with very minor changes that could be remedied with further linuxkpi extensions:


Files with minor unavoidable differences:
intel_display.c - outb/inb on linux order the arguments in reverse, pci accessor differences, seq_file vs sbuf
intel_dp.c - msleep() differs on linux so DRM_MSLEEP, slightly different args to DRM_KMS_DEBUG
intel_i2c.c - need to destroy mutexes
intel_fb.c - differences in framebuffer interface / a MUCH better job needs to be done in reconciling XXX
intel_lvds.c - linuxkpi needs a notifier block interface that maps to EVENTHANDLER - FREEBSD_WIP for now


Files that fundamentally differ due to VM/PCI etc
i915_dma.c - manipulates devices / rman, although there are many gratuitous API differences
	   with drm_ prefixing many functions that are otherwise shim routines




Next file to update:



FreeBSD needs to destroy it's locks to make WITNESS unhappy - (either that or not register them with WITNESS)


NOTE that MODULE_PARM_DESC should itself define sysctl/TUNABLE_INT
All throughout need to s/CTR/trace/
