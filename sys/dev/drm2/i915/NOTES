Files with no changes against uptstream:


Files with very minor changes that could be remedied with further linuxkpi extensions:



Files that fundamentally differ due to VM/PCI etc
i915_dma.c - manipulates devices / rman, although there are many gratuitous API differences
	   with drm_ prefixing many functions that are otherwise shim routines




Next file to update:
intel_dp.c
