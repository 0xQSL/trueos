Files with very minor changes that could be remedied with further linuxkpi extensions (B):
i915_gem_context.c - single difference in reference counting
intel_lvds.c - linuxkpi needs a notifier block interface that maps to EVENTHANDLER - FREEBSD_WIP for now
intel_panel.c - TUNABLE_INT needs to be rolled in to MODULE_PARM_DESC



Files with minor unavoidable differences (C):
i915_gem_tiling.c - vm_page_t vs sgl
i915_irq.c
	- irq handler API difference, KTR usage, lack of kobject_uevent_env on FreeBSD,
	- callout API difference
	- no direct access to device_t

intel_acpi.c - FreeBSD maintains Intel's camel case naming convention in ACPI, Linux does not
intel_bios.c - Linux const sloppiness, different name for mapping bios, freebsd actually frees parsed bios data
intel_display.c - outb/inb on linux order the arguments in reverse, pci accessor differences, seq_file vs sbuf
intel_dp.c - msleep() differs on linux so DRM_MSLEEP, slightly different args to DRM_KMS_DEBUG
intel_i2c.c - need to destroy mutexes
intel_fb.c - differences in framebuffer interface / a MUCH better job needs to be done in reconciling XXX
intel_opregion.c - differences in ACPI interface - lack of acpi notifier
intel_overlay.c - unused variables except with INVARIANTS


intel_pm.c
	- difference in frequency handling - need cpufreq_quick_get_max(),
	- TR1 register conflicts with KTR defines
	- nanotime difference
	- linker difference (symbol_get)
intel_ringbuffer.c
	- use of kva_alloc instead of pages in an sgl attached to the obj -> pmap
	- drm_pci_alloc interface difference
	- msleep

intel_sdvo.c
	- linux is much sloppier about constness with its casting
	- original bits kept for use in building i2c kpi
intel_tv.c - one instance of const sloppiness






Files that fundamentally differ due to VM/PCI etc (D):
i915_dma.c - manipulates devices / rman, although there are many gratuitous API differences
	   with drm_ prefixing many functions that are otherwise shim routines
i915_drv.c
	- pci accessors
	- missing suspend / resume functionality in freebsd
	- wait for usage to avoid LOR
	- probe semantics
	- prime unsupported
	- pager operations
	- module dependencies
i915_gem_execbuffer.c - KTR, VM
i915_gem_gtt.c - large delta due to VM differences
i915_gem_stolen.c - vm_page_t vs sgl - unlikely to be fully functional
i915_ioc32.c - completely different ioctl interface from Linux


Unused (E):
i915_gem_debug.c
i915_gem_dmabuf.c

Next file to update:



FreeBSD needs to destroy it's locks to make WITNESS unhappy - (either that or not register them with WITNESS)


NB:
	- MODULE_PARM_DESC should itself define sysctl/TUNABLE_INT
	- All throughout need to s/CTR/trace/
	- Need to convert mmio usage to regs
	- kunmap takes a page not a virtual address (kunmap_atomic takes a vaddr)
