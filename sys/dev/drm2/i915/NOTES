Files with very minor changes that could be remedied with further linuxkpi extensions:


Files with minor unavoidable differences:
intel_display.c - outb/inb on linux order the arguments in reverse, pci accessor differences, seq_file vs sbuf
intel_dp.c - msleep() differs on linux so DRM_MSLEEP, slightly different args to DRM_KMS_DEBUG
intel_i2c.c - need to destroy mutexes
intel_fb.c - differences in framebuffer interface / a MUCH better job needs to be done in reconciling XXX
intel_lvds.c - linuxkpi needs a notifier block interface that maps to EVENTHANDLER - FREEBSD_WIP for now
intel_opregion.c - differencs in ACPI interface - lack of acpi notifier
intel_overlay.c - unused variables except with INVARIANTS, sbuf vs seq_file
intel_panel.c - TUNABLE_INT needs to be rolled in to MODULE_PARM_DESC
intel_pm.c
	- difference in frequency handling - need cpufreq_quick_get_max(),
	- TR1 register conflicts with KTR defines
	- nanotime difference
	- linker difference (symbol_get)
intel_ringbuffer.c
	- use of kva_alloc instead of pages in an sgl attached to the obj -> pmap
	- drm_pci_alloc interface difference
	- KTR usage
	- msleep

intel_sdvo.c
	- device parent not directly accessible
	- linux is much sloppier about constness with its casting
	- original bits kept for use in building i2c kpi
intel_tv.c - one instance of const sloppiness

Files that fundamentally differ due to VM/PCI etc
i915_dma.c - manipulates devices / rman, although there are many gratuitous API differences
	   with drm_ prefixing many functions that are otherwise shim routines




Next file to update:



FreeBSD needs to destroy it's locks to make WITNESS unhappy - (either that or not register them with WITNESS)


NOTE that MODULE_PARM_DESC should itself define sysctl/TUNABLE_INT
All throughout need to s/CTR/trace/
